# Instructions:
You can open the HTML file with your preferred browser, and that's it - you can edit it if you'd like. There is also a web page with sound that I put so you can just drag the file to your
browser or your favorite IDE and integrate it with the web page.

If you have any problems or comments, please post them in the issues section on GitHub. I'm always on the lookout!

# Credits:
RafaDEV99 makes these scripts. You can use these freely as learning how scripts work; however, don't copy the same script and don't say it's yours :D

Thanks for respecting my work and happy coding!

# Add your things (if you want!)
Yes, you can also add whatever you like to the project, even if you are not good at programming, but want to add a message of your own. Feel free to commit with a new message or something you want to add to the code!

Thank you for looking at my project!

# Cool things to do!
These are some cool features you can implement:
1. You can change the CSS file!
2. Add more images
3. Also add functionality
4. and more!

Remenber to respect my work!!! :3
