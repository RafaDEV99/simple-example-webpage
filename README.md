# Instructions:
Open the HTML file with your favorite browser, and that's it; you can edit it if you want. There is also a web page with sound that I put so you can just drag the file to your
browser or your favorite IDE and integrate it with the web page.

If you have any problems or comments, post them in the problems section on GitHub. I'm always on the lookout!!!!
And that's it, you can now use the web page with sound and images, you can also add more pictures and sounds if you want, just put them in the same folder as the HTML file and change the code to your liking.

# Credits:
These scripts are made by RafaDEV99. You can use these freely as learning how scripts work; however, don't copy the same script and don't say it's yours :D

Thanks for respecting my work and happy coding!
