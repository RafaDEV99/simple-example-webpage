## What do I need to fix?

1. Rewrite the HTML structure
2. Add an example
3. If I can, also, I will also try React or something else

So that`s all I need to fix for now!
I donÂ´t know if at any moment I need to update this note to have something
And also, I realised that the HTML is really bad...
Well, I need to fix that!
